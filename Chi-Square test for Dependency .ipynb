    "The Chi-Squared test is a statistical hypothesis test that assumes (the null hypothesis) that the **observed frequencies** for a categorical variable match the **expected frequencies** for the categorical variable. The Chi-Squared test does this for a contingency table, first calculating the expected frequencies for the groups, then determining whether the division of the groups, called the observed frequencies, matches the expected frequencies.\n",

    "   When observed frequency is far from the expected frequency, the corresponding term in the sum is large; when the two are close, this term is small. Large values of **Chi-square** indicate that observed and expected frequencies are far apart. Small values of **Chi-square** mean the opposite: observed are close to expected. \n",
